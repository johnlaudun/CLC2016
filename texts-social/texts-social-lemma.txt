if this is indeed correct, there isn't anything worse in a civilized society than the attempt to lure children into abuse.

Ask your brother, Sarah.
I don't know if this is real or fake. I didn't take this video or the pictures. A friend of my son sent these to him. I am not saying this is real. I don't know if this is a creepy man or woman or teen. I don't know if this is a person playing a prank. All I'm saying is there are news reports everywhere warning about this. I am simply saying to be careful and be cautious and lookout. That's all.
So, I was a little scared to post this because I didn't think anyone would believe me until Kelly Hill told me that one of her friends just had seen a clown here in London. Amy Gunter And I was out tonight & was headed back home on 192 & saw this. Now, it's not a really good picture because I couldn't stop, there was people behind me. I seriously think this clown thing has gotten out of hand & someone is going to get hurt. Please share this so people around London will know that they are here! 1,5311 shares 559 comments

My school banned any form of jacket, coat or hoodie since literally no one wore trench coats.
Which was awesome because they kept the classrooms at like 60-65 degrees. "Dress warmer! ...But not like that!"

My middle school at least makes money off of their inconvenient policies. This is a public school with a school uniform and they banned the old uniform from about 5 or 6 years ago and so people who were using their older siblings hand be downs had to go out and buy one of the newer versions.
permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply
[–]Bobbled_It 4 points 5 months ago 
are you fucking shitting me? holy crap that makes me upset. one of my friends was the youngest of 3 boys and got SO MANY hand me downs. My favorite were his older brothers corduroys. They were the thick cord type, none of that skinny cord shit that looks like jeans. Well, his brothers liked to party and they played ruit (beer pong) often on tables that would go upto to their thighs. So my friends cords all had the cords worn off completely just in small rectangles where the pleats in pleated pants usually end. It was funny.
Oh and most of the cords around the dick area were also gone. So many over the pants junk adjustments through the years. Oh Stephen, but yeah, I also had the missing dick cords and my cords weren't passed down. Fuck....

The thing that annoyed me about the whole thing is there was a fairly large group of goth/punk children in my school who had been wearing trench coats for well before Columbine. It seems u fair to infringe on their cultural expression because of two asshole children. Had the children at Columbine been wearing sports jerseys or sweater vest would we have had the same policy?

One of my cousins had Starter jackets banned at her schools in the 90s because of asshole children getting into fights over them. The old times were not better, there just wasn't a pervasive internet or social media to bitch about it on so everyone seems to think such bullshit did not occur.

They banned all outerwear in my school when I was in 6th grade, which I believe was around the same time that the shooting happened at Columbine. Me being the asshole kid I was pointed out the fact that the entire administration wore suits, which had jackets. They changed the rule to allow students to wear suits to school, which I promptly began doing.

It's weird to hear just how different high schools are across the nation. When I was in high school everyone used both lockers and back-packs. I couldn't imagine life without a locker, who has room to fit 6 books and 6 binders in a backpack?
permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply
[–]Proditus 5 points 5 months ago* 
For me at least, I think my situation was similar to the poster above. From the time the final bell sounded, I had 5 minutes to get from my classroom to the bus before it left. There is no time to stop and use a locker when you run the risk of missing your bus and having to find another way home. It was simply easier to just carry everything on your person throughout the day, which also eliminated the possibility of forgetting important things in your locker.
As for textbooks, there were ways around it. Only rarely was I required to cart books between the class and home. In most cases, I could leave my books at home because they were only used for homework. In some cases, there would be books that stay in the classroom to be used by multiple classes, and we would either have our own copy at home or just not need them for homework. My backpack could get very heavy at times, but it was manageable. Almost 10 years later and my shoulders only hurt a little bit now.

My school did a similar thing but it was all bags. Though the reason had less to do with concealing weapons and more to do with how crowded my school was. The idea was if people weren't all wearing bulky backpacks and coats all through the school there would be more room in the halls. It kinda did help too.

I know it's not your logic, but by that logic we should ban pants because you can fit a knife in your pocket. Part of the reason for the ban was that the boys were in the "trench coat mafia" and it glorified the piece of clothing. I get why they did it, I just don't agree with it.

If it's the same one everyone is talking about, then it's just a clown, not a clown terrorizing people. That isn't to say all of this is marketing, it's halloween and I'm sure copycats exist.

After Columbine at my school if your backpack wasn't net mesh or transparent plastic it would be confiscated.
Some children couldn't readily afford "acceptable" replacements.
Also this was before you could just get online and get what you needed in a couple days. There were people lined up buying "acceptable" backpacks and many places were sold out.
It was completely absurd

To be fair, it's possible they banned the clown costumes due to the fear that other people would shoot them/hit them with a car upon seeing them. It's not so much the fear of them doing something, but the fear of others doing something to them. I'm sure we've all seen enough people suggesting they would attack anyone in a clown costume in strange places.

Yep. However, just to be fair, there are a lot of fucking clown sightings popping up in this state, several of which have been reports of clown trying to lure children into cars or the woods with candy.
Not sure why there has to be an outright ban though. The schools could have just said "if you're going to be a clown, use face paint and not a mask that completely hides your identity". That should apply to all costumes though, not just clown.

Nobody trying that here so far. (I'm in Ohio) But my friend on Facebook have seen people doing it one was in his neighborhood. This friend actually talked to one. He was a teenager just scaring people for fun, but he warned him it's probably best not to do it anymore. No, the kid did not listen. It's scaring his kid and pissing him off. I keep saying, "Someone's going to get hurt, and it's going to be someone in a clown mask."

They've made their way over to Oregon. There's already a story of a 21 year old woman who had one in a black/silver clown mask come up to her car. Guy started banging on the hood and trying to open the door.
Needless to say, someone is going to get killed over this. It's not even about clown in this case. Anyone coming up to your vehicle, banging on it and trying to open your door is asking for trouble and they're eventually going to find it.

All these reports and not one video or picture. This is in a society where girls take 30 pictures when going to the bathroom.
I don't know if you guys have heard, but there's been a string of creepy clown sightings across the US. I don't know if this person was just fucking with me or what, but I saw one of them up on the fire trails a few minutes ago.
Its hair was almost white and standing on end. It was wearing this weird oversized shirt with bright oranges and yellows. I couldn't see its eyes but I know it was staring at me.

Ay imma pop a cap in yo funky clown ass
I know this may sound pretty fucking stupid, but about the clown, since they are popping up all over the place, could it be a secret cult we never really knew about? I was thinking about this for a while since the clown popped up and shit.
I'm fucking terrified for my life because of the clown and finding them in the places I found that where I thought was safe. (Codeword:"was"). I'm even scared for my lil sibs when they go to school...
But back to my theory,
What if the clown really is a cult or a large group of people who think that they could possibly strike the world down if they start dressing up and making people fear them to feel power. Or maybe the murders they do is a form of sacrifice or something.
I don't know. This is just word vomit and my theory on this.
I fucking hate clown now because of all this bullshit man.
What are you're thoughts on this though. It would be awesome to see what you guys think. Tarrem 2 points 5 months ago 
I think that shit is gonna hit the fan on Halloween. I thought about dressing up as a clown, take TWD approach, but then I saw people beating up the clown so I'm just going to lock my doors and stay home where I hope is safe. Also, this thing is either gonna go away when IT comes out, or get a lot worse.

[–]fuckgangstarap 1 point 5 months ago 
yeah man they kill people.. you gotta watch your back out there.
This happened to me about 7 years ago. I remember everything that had happened(where I'd been and who I'd been with)that day. It was about 3:50 P.M. on a Friday just shortly after school. I got an invitation to a friends house for a party because his parents were out of town for a couple of days. The party started at about 6:30 P.M.(just 30 minutes after his parents had left to go on a trip for their wedding anniversary) so by 5:30 I had gotten all of my things packed because I planned to spend the night and wanted to bring over some of my things. The drive there was about an hour long so I had made sure that I was prepared early enough so that I'd get there on time. About 30 minutes into my drive getting there I stopped at a stop sign in the middle of the country. Now, this was in the middle of the night and there was nobody around. Just as I started to head up the road I swear to God I about literally crapped myself(A CLOWN). I heard about clown showing up in weird places in the middle of the night and even sometimes during the day. But this clown was different; the clown had intentionally walked in front of my truck so I had to stop for him. This is when things got even creepier; he just stood there for what felt like forever(even though it was only 10 minutes past). He gave me this creepy looking smile(that's when I stepped on the gas and got the heck out of there. So, about 20 minutes later I had arrived at my friends house. As I walked into the house my friend met me and said your late and told him immediately why. Holy crap, he said. That's seriously creepy as hell, I've heard about that stuff happening a lot on the news but nowhere around here. So time flew by as there was so much to do at the party; we drank,talked about stuff, and played games(it was a lot of fun). The time was almost midnight when all of a sudden the door bell rang. "Henry is what I will call my friend." I asked him were you expecting anyone? Could you're parents had their plans be cancelled all of a sudden? No! He said. Nobody else was supposed to show up especially at this time of night and my parents would've called me if anything if their plans had gotten cancelled. So, Henry and I went to go look through the window just upstairs so we could see if their was anybody or anything outside. I'm telling you I about fucking threw up when I saw the most disturbing thing that I had ever seen in my whole life. It was THAT CLOWN(Ronald McDonald), just standing outside the door with his balloons and a sign that read free candy for whoever follows me. As soon as Henry saw him he called his parents immediately. His parents said to lock the door along with the windows and close the blinds and call the police immediately. As soon as Henry hung up the phone I gave him a nod and we both raced down the stairs and did exactly that. We stayed up after that for about an hour since we were getting tired. About 10 hours later we woke up to a mess. Henry said, man we really had a good time last night didn't we.(forgetting about the clown I said yeah I had a great time). Henry said while you're still here could you help me clean the place up. With nothing else to do for the rest of the day I insisted on helping him. 2 hours had passed away and that's when I was about to leave when I saw the clown's sign laying there on the ground outside. I panicked and quickly ran back into Henry's house. What's the matter he asked? Dude remember that creepy clown that we saw last night I think it might still be here, he left his sign just outside. We both looked behind us and were terrified to the sound of glass breaking in his kitchen. I yelled, the clown is in the house! We have to go right now! When I said that we both ran through the front door and hopped into my truck and got the fuck out of there. How did he get into your house, I said? We locked everything. Henry said that he could've broken in busting shattering open a window. The thought of the clown in his house gave us both chills. Henry asked me if he could stay overnight for a couple of nights until he's ready to go back home. I said sure dude it's fine. He thanked me gladly. It was about 3 days later that Henry finally went back to his house as his parents had come back from their anniversary out of town. I told Henry make sure to call me if anything Ronald McDonald related had happened. Henry called back about an hour later with a panicking sound in his voice. Tyler, oh no!He said. Henry what's the problem, I asked? It's-its my parents dude, they're-they're dead. I told him that I'd be on my way. By the time I got to his house Henry was on the roof of his house crying. I asked him if the clown was there, he said that the clown was inside the house and had tried to stab him. He said that there was blood all over the living room floor from his parents dead bodies. I immediately called the cops as soon as he said this. The police got there and ran into the house and pulled the clown out of a closet. They said that the clown had been smothering his faces in Henry's parents blood! I just about puked when they said that. That is extremely creepy I yelled. As the police brought the clown out of the house the clown looked at me with a smile on his face and said I'll come back for you, for both of you. The clown had gone to jail for a couple a years I was told for murder. The even creepier thing was that when we were told who it was I felt shrivels down my spine as it was one of the people that was invited to the party. He had been watching us the whole time. I'm glad that that sicko gets to go away for a long time as I also hope that I will never see a creepy clown ever again. TheWaffleH0use 1 point 5 months ago

Yeah, i get it...it might seem funny to you. But chasing little children with a machete is a poor decision. Several fathers (including myself) will not hesitate to put you in your place if you threaten children.
I totally understand pranks and i don't mean to sound like a debbie downer. But in my opinion, chasing elementary children with a knife is too far.

I think this trend is really stupid. I saw some (literal) clown running at me, I'd kick him in the balls. But the machete thing is way over the top.

This. Add a machete to the equation and that guy is going to get taken out. I wouldn't necessarily run him over in a car (suggested by other Redditor) but there would be a physical take down with some degree of measured violence, and then the police would be called whilst said clown was restrained.

For the record:
I'm cool with a little vigilante justice if the more efficient means have been exhausted.

I have no problem with the creepy clown stuff, but when they start wielding weapons... that's a whole other level of dangerous stupidity.
Don't wield weapons creepy clown. Asking for trouble, pretty sure it's an criminal offence as well.

Not in Ottawa it's not. That's a different non-clown related thing.

If I saw anyone chasing children while wielding a machete I would run that fucker over with my car if I at all could.

No you wouldn't. It sure is fun playing make belief on the internet though!

In all honesty, someone is going to get hurt. Its a reasonable conclusion to think that "the guy dressed as a clown chasing you/your children with a machete" means to do them harm.
Running over them with a car is pretty indefensible, but hitting them with a bat or hockey stick? That's probably not going to result in charges, because "It was just a prank, bro" is a terrible defense.

you never know, specially if they were his children. I can totally understand how a father may take a baseball bat to a clown chasing his child with a knife. running the clown down with a car is not a far fetch from that.

No one considers that in the heat of the moment. That's how bad things happen.

What would happen if this actually happened? Clown chasing children with a knife or anyone and they defend themselves because they feel as though their life is being threatened and the clown gets hurt or killed?

[–]Osprey9Sandy Hill 8 points 5 months ago 
Self-defence laws in Canada are not nearly as relaxed as in the U.S.. If someone did run over a machete wielding clown and kill them with their car it would most likely result in some type of manslaughter charge against the driver.
permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply
[–]shitheadho 4 points 5 months ago 
It would. But I would be so freaked out I would run them over out of fear if I didn't have a heart attack first. I am deathly afraid if clown.
permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply
[–]Goshawk77 3 points 5 months ago 
Super situational. Law allows use of appropriate force in defending your life or that of others.. within reason.
Mowing down a clown who's about to murder children with a machete would almost definitely see charges laid against you.
Would you see jail? With a good lawyer and enough reliable witnesses / CCTV... probably not.
Imo anyway.

I honestly don't get why people do this, have fun with the mask and let people know it's a joke. It really just takes making someone with psychosis like myself to make this into an even worse situation.

Clown grafittid a school in old Barrhaven this morning. I drove by it wasn't there last night.
If I find the little fuckers doing THAT I will spraypaint smiles on their faces.
So. I was wondering... What is a good weapon to scare away those annoying clown? :D I saw these clown and thought, I'm not going to be running away from them. Should I just get a knife? [–]Gooblygoo68 13 points 5 months ago

Just saying using a weapon to threaten them is illegal as long as they are unarmed and nonviolent

[–]nra092098 1 point 5 months ago 
In many states someone running at you is protected by the stand your ground law and you can shoot them
permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply
[–]Waex 1 point 5 months ago 
nonviolent
permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply
[–]nra092098 1 point 5 months ago 
Running full speed at someone is threatening. After warning them you are clear to shoot them
permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply
[–]Waex 1 point 5 months ago 
Yes that is considered violent. That was not my point. I'm just talkin about the 99% of them who are just chillin

A bat is easier to use. If they have a knife and u have one, its a skill battle.

thanks for the advice on what to bring(except those who said to bring lubricant and condoms. wtf are we supposed to do with those? XD)
permalinkembedsavereportgive goldreply
[–]fisher_king_toronto 1 point 5 months ago 
Bullet proof vests, anti-clown net, beating sticks, condoms, lubricant.
permalinkembedsavereportgive goldreply
[–]fisher_king_toronto 1 point 5 months ago 
Also bring a curing kit if you want to skin the clown and keep the pelt as a trophy to hang up on your wall.
If you have a clown hunting permit, you'll be allowed to hunt clown younger then 18 years of age. If not, you're only allowed to hunt clown that're clearly over the age of majority.
If you choose to collect clown pelts, there's a current limit of half a dozen per hunt.

Tasers! They're extremely cheap on amazon, only $10 dollars!
This happened a few days ago when I went to a fair that came to my town. I have alot of friends so I went with them. I'm a young teenager to protect my age. The fair was OK but at 9.45 me and my friend who I will call Jake was walking out of the fair.
As we were waiting for our parents we heard a noise. It was fairly dark but there was lights so it was OK. Suddenly a man came out from the carpark and told us run. When we look behind us we saw a man in a clown mask. We weren't scared until we saw a FUCKING KNIFE IN HIS HAND. We ran and wen we realised he was chasing us we ran like mad down the street.
The clown was still chasing us no matter where we went. This is when hide and seek began. We hid in a bush but our luck wasn't great and he followed us in the bushes. He searched around and at 1 point I could almost feel him. It was dark so he couldn't see us. He left the bush and continued searching else where.
We ran pack to the car park and our parents were just there. We didn't tell them but probably should have. I said goodbye to Jake and went home. I went home to and went OK. I don't know what that clown intentions were or if it was a prank but man in the clown mask let's not meet.

This web app, which can run on any devices, though bare-bones at the moment, is to be used for safety measures and tracking clown for "clown hunting" groups.
It appears there isn't any form of verification at the moment (so fake sightings could be reported atm..), though I have word from the developer that this is coming within the next few days.
